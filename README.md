# Challenge 4

## JavaScript Quiz

A JavaScript quiz that can test one's knoweledge. I made this quiz to help myself and others be able to have fun studying the concepts of JavaScript. I made the entire page from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Just recently I learned about third party APIs and the advantages to them. As I wrapped this up I can defnitely see how using those APIs would make this entire process much easier.
